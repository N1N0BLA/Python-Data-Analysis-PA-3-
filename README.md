# Python Data Analysis with Pandas
This repository contains solutions for Experiment 3 of the course Advanced Computer Programming and Algorithms (ECE 2112) at the University of Santo Tomas, Faculty of Engineering. The experiment focuses on using Python's Pandas library for data analysis.

## Objective
The goal of this experiment is to:

Identify and use functions within the Pandas library.
Apply these functions to analyze and manipulate a dataset using Python.
##Assignment Overview
The tasks in this assignment are divided into two problems, both involving operations on a dataset related to cars. The dataset can be found here.

Problem 1: Loading and Displaying Data
File: Surname_Pandas-P1.py

Load the car dataset into a DataFrame using Pandas.
Display the first and last five rows of the DataFrame.
Problem 2: Data Subsetting, Slicing, and Indexing
File: Surname_Pandas-P2.py

Using the DataFrame created in Problem 1, perform the following tasks:

Display the first five rows but only for odd-numbered columns (1, 3, 5, 7, etc.).
Display the row corresponding to the car model 'Mazda RX4'.
Determine how many cylinders the car model 'Camaro Z28' has.
Extract the number of cylinders and gear type for the following car models:
Mazda RX4 Wag
Ford Pantera L
Honda Civic
